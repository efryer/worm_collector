# worm_collector
This repo is dedicated to retrieving data for automated worm counting for the Neuroplant project

## To Run:
1. Change file path at line 28 to match your home directory.

2. All pre and post images are included in this repo, along with manual annotations.

3. Worms are exported as a .csv file 'confirmed_worms.csv'. Worms can also be accesed as a list of dictionaries: 'results'.
